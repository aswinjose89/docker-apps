    # An important note about accessing Kafka from clients on other machines: 
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # The config used here exposes port 29092 for _external_ connections to the broker
    # i.e. those from _outside_ the docker network. This could be from the host machine
    # running docker, or maybe further afield if you've got a more complicated setup. 
    # If the latter is true, you will need to change the value 'localhost' in 
    # KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS to one that is resolvable to the docker host from those 
    # remote clients
    #
    # For connections _internal_ to the docker network, such as from other services
    # and components, use kafka:9092.
