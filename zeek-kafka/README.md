# Zeek and Kafka Integration with Docker, librdkafka, and ZeekJS

## Overview

This setup involves using Zeek, an open-source network monitoring tool, to generate logs, which are then sent to Kafka, a distributed streaming platform. The integration leverages Docker containers for ease of deployment and management, while librdkafka, a C library for Apache Kafka, handles the communication between Zeek and Kafka. Additionally, ZeekJS, a JavaScript runtime for Zeek, is included to enable writing Zeek scripts in JavaScript for more flexible and dynamic processing.

## Architecture

The system runs in a distributed environment, allowing Zeek instances, Kafka brokers, and other components to operate on separate remote machines. This setup enhances scalability and flexibility in managing the network monitoring infrastructure.

## Implementation Steps

### Zeek Docker Image Setup

- Create a Docker image for Zeek, including the necessary configurations to send logs to Kafka.
- Include librdkafka and ZeekJS in the Docker image to enable Kafka communication and JavaScript scripting.
- Volume mount the `local.zeek` file from the host machine to the container to allow customizable configurations.

### Kafka Setup

- Deploy Kafka brokers in a distributed manner, either using Docker or directly on the host machines.
- Ensure Kafka is accessible to Zeek instances via the network.

### Configuration

#### Zeek Configuration (Optional)

The main Zeek configuration file, `local.zeek`, is used to customize Zeek's behavior, including logging settings and which scripts to load. Include JavaScript scripts with ZeekJS for dynamic processing capabilities. This file is volume-mounted into the Docker container, allowing changes to be made on the host machine without rebuilding the Docker image.

Example configuration in `local.zeek`:

```zeek

# Configure Kafka output
@load packages/zeek-kafka
redef Kafka::send_all_active_logs = T;
redef Kafka::tag_json = T;
redef Kafka::kafka_conf = table(
    ["metadata.broker.list"] = "localhost:29092"
);

# JavaScript processing using ZeekJS
event zeek_init() {
    # Example: Load a JavaScript file
    ZeekJS::load_script("scripts/example.js");
}
```

### Execution Steps

Command to find network interface name
```
nmcli device status or ifconfig
```

Docker Compose command
```
docker-compose -f zeek-kafka-compose.yml up
``` 

List kafka topics from the container
```
docker exec -it kafka-cntr bash /bin/kafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

Consume messages from the topic name 'zeek'
```
docker exec -it kafka-cntr bash /bin/kafka-console-consumer --topic zeek --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

Get zeek docker file at 
```
