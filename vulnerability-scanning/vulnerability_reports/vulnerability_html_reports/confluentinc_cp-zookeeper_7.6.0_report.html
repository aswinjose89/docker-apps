Suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments, so it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. The applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.

Suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments, so it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function.

By controlling the delay of the malicious authoritative answers, Unbound slowly accumulates pending answers for the spoofed addresses. When the authoritative answers become available to Unbound at the same time, Unbound starts serving all the accumulated queries. This results in large-sized, concentrated response bursts to the spoofed addresses.</td>
